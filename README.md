- As a company, we want to ensure the website has a professional and appealing design to create a positive impression.


## Design

### Typography

The primary font used throughout the website is Arial, sans-serif, providing a clean and professional look. Various font sizes are implemented to create a clear hierarchy, making it easy to differentiate between headings, subheadings, and body text.

### Color Scheme

The color scheme of the project is inspired by a sleek, modern design. The primary color is black (#000) which is used for the sidebar background and text, creating a strong contrast. The secondary color is white (#fff) for the main content background, ensuring readability. An accent color of bright blue (#0008fe) is used for buttons and hover effects, adding a pop of color and enhancing the user interface. Additional colors include gray (#adb5bd) for secondary text and light gray (#f9f9f9) for sections like the contact form background.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created to plan the structure and layout of the website. They provided a clear visual representation of the user interface, helping to streamline the design and development process. Key wireframes include:

[Desktop]()
[Tablet]()
[Mobile]()

#### Entity-Relationship Diagram

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/testing/erd.webp" alt="Entity-Relationship Diagram"></div>

This ERD provides a clear structure of how different entities relate to each other within the project database.

## Agile Workflow

### Epics, User Stories and Tasks

In this project, Agile methodologies were employed to ensure a flexible and iterative approach to development. The work was divided into Epics, User Stories, and Tasks, managed through GitHub Project Boards.

Epics are large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks or User Stories. They represent significant areas of functionality within the project. Examples of Epics in this project include:

- User Management
- Booking System
- Website Content and Structure
- Payment and Transactions
- User Experience and Accessibility

#### User Stories

User Stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user. Each User Story addresses specific user needs and provides value to the end-user. Examples of User Stories in this project include:

1. User Registration and Authentication
2. Booking System
3. Consultant Profiles
4. Contact Information and Inquiry Form
5. Advanced Search and Filters for Consultations
6. Secure Payment System
7. Real-time Notifications

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/testing/user_story.webp" alt="User Stories List"></div>

#### Tasks

Tasks are the individual steps needed to complete a User Story. They are the smallest units of work in the Agile workflow. Examples of Tasks for the User Story "User Registration and Authentication" might include:

- Create the registration form
- Implement user authentication
- Validate user input
- Set up email verification

### Github Project Boards

GitHub Project Boards were used to manage the project's workflow and track progress.

#### User Stores List

The User Stories List provides an overview of all User Stories, their status, priority, and assignees.

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/testing/user_stories_list.webp" alt="User Stories List"></div>

#### Kanban Board

The Kanban Board visualizes the flow of work, showing what is to be done, what is in progress, and what has been completed. This helps in managing tasks efficiently and ensures that the team is focused on the current priorities.

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/testig/kanban_board.webp" alt="Kanban Board"></div>

#### MoSCoW Prioritization

MoSCoW Prioritization was used to categorize the User Stories based on their importance:

- **Must Have**: Critical features that are essential for the MVP.
- **Should Have**: Important features that are not critical but add significant value.
- **Could Have**: Nice-to-have features that enhance the user experience.
- **Won't Have**: Features that are out of scope for the current development cycle.

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/testing/moscow.webp" alt="MoSCoW Prioritization"></div>

#### Story Points and Stars 

Story Points and Stars were used to estimate the effort required to complete each User Story. This helps in planning and allocating resources effectively.

#### Project Milestones

Project Milestones were set to track the progress of the project. Each milestone represents a significant point in the project timeline, such as the completion of the MVP or the implementation of critical features.

#### MVP Milestone

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Milestone includes the essential features needed to deploy a functional version of the application. This milestone focuses on delivering the core functionality.

#### Post-MVP Milestone

The Post-MVP Milestone includes additional features and enhancements that were not included in the initial MVP. These features aim to improve the user experience and add more value to the application.

#### Enhancement Milestone

The Enhancement Milestone includes ongoing improvements and optimizations to the application. This milestone ensures that the application remains up-to-date and continues to meet user needs.

1. Clone the repository from GitHub by clicking the "Code" button and copying the URL.
2. Open your preferred IDE and open a terminal session in the directory you want to clone the repository to.
3. Type git clone followed by the URL you copied in step 1 and press enter.
4. (Optional): Set up a virtual environment in the project folder using python3 -m venv [virtual_environment name]
5. (Optional): To activate the virtual environment on Windows run myvenv\Scripts\activate and on macOS and Linux, run source myvenv/bin/activate
6. Install the required dependencies by typing pip install -r requirements.txt in the terminal.
- Note: The project is setup to use environment variables. You will need to set these up in your local environment. See Environment Variables for more information.
7. Connect your database of choice and run the migrations by typing python manage.py migrate in the terminal.
8. Create a superuser by typing python manage.py createsuperuser in the terminal and following the prompts.
9. (Optional):: Fixtures for Users and also the individual blog posts are included in the project in the fixtures directory. To add the pre-populated data to the database, run python manage.py loaddata fixtures/[fixture_name].json.
10. Run the app by typing python manage.py runserver in the terminal and opening the URL in your browser.

#### Heroku Deployment

1. Ensure the project repository has been uploaded to Github.
2. Login to the Heroku dashboard and create a new app.
3. Connect your GitHub repository to your Heroku app.

6. In the Deploy tab, enable automatic deploys from your GitHub repository.
7. Click the "Deploy Branch" button to deploy the app.
8. Once the app has been deployed, click the "Open App" button to view the app.

#### Environment Variables

For local deployment, you will need to create a .env file in the root directory of the project and set the environment variables in this file.

- Note: Ensure the .env file is included in the .gitignore file to exclude it from your GitHub repo to prevent the environment variables from being publicly exposed.

For Heroku deployment, you will need to set the environment variables through the Heroku CLI or through the Heroku dashboard under 'Config Vars'.

You need to define the following environment variables:

- SECRET_KEY: The secret key for your Django project. This is a critical setting that's used for cryptographic signing, and should be kept secret at all times. It's used to provide cryptographic signing, and should be a long, random string of bytes.

- DEBUG: A boolean that turns on/off debug mode. Set to True for development to enable detailed error pages and logging for debugging. Set to False in production to improve performance and security.

- DATABASE_URL: The URL for your database. This should include the database engine, username, password, host, port, and database name. For a Postgres database, it typically looks like postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB_NAME.

- CLOUDINARY_API_KEY: Your Cloudinary account's API key. This key is used to authenticate requests to Cloudinary's services for uploading and managing images and other media assets.

- CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET: Your Cloudinary account's API secret. This secret is used alongside the API key to securely sign requests to Cloudinary.

- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME: Your Cloudinary account's cloud name. This is the unique name that identifies your cloud within Cloudinary. It's used in the URL structure for accessing uploaded resources.
