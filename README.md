## Design

### Typography

The primary font used throughout the website is Arial, sans-serif, providing a clean and professional look. Various font sizes are implemented to create a clear hierarchy, making it easy to differentiate between headings, subheadings, and body text.

### Color Scheme

The color scheme of the project is inspired by a sleek, modern design. The primary color is black (#000) which is used for the sidebar background and text, creating a strong contrast. The secondary color is white (#fff) for the main content background, ensuring readability. An accent color of bright blue (#0008fe) is used for buttons and hover effects, adding a pop of color and enhancing the user interface. Additional colors include gray (#adb5bd) for secondary text and light gray (#f9f9f9) for sections like the contact form background.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created to plan the structure and layout of the website. They provided a clear visual representation of the user interface, helping to streamline the design and development process. Key wireframes include:

Desktop wireframe
